# 🎀 Titido

An app built with React to organize tasks, with filters for completed and uncompleted ones. It allows editing and deleting each task.

## 📝 Technologies

- `React`
- `CSS`
- `useReducer`
- `useContext`
- `useId` 

## 🧠 The Process

The purpose of this app was to continue deepening my knowledge of React hooks and to strengthen my understanding of array immutability. The main steps included creating an input field to add new tasks, displaying them with filtering options (`completed` / `not completed`), and enabling users to edit or delete tasks.  
Each task is persisted using `localStorage`.
