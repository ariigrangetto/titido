<h1>ðŸ“– Titido</h1>

This is a simple to-do app built with React. I used useReducer and useContext to manage the state globally. It lets you add, edit, and delete tasks easily and you can filter your taks by completed or not completed. I built it to practice more advanced state management in React and keep the code clean and scalable.
